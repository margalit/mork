Mörk Chocolate is a small business. We have one foot in the world of fine chocolate and one in the world of specialty coffee, with over ten years of professional experience in both Australia and Europe. "Mörk" is Swedish for dark, and the name speaks both to our shared history and our devotion to dark, pure chocolate.


Why do we dedicate ourselves to chocolate?

We have always loved chocolate: one of us since the age of three, sneaking downstairs many a winter night to steal the foil-wrapped chocolate santas from off the Christmas tree, careful to hide the wrappers where no one would find them; the other ever since the very first meeting with that same girl, then an experienced chocolatier, while she was demonstrating the tempering of dark chocolate at a coffee roastery in Sweden.

We call ourselves the Cacao Artisans of Melbourne. With our dedication to chocolate follows a tremendous amount of respect for the product: we work with the purest form of chocolate—cacao liquor—and the finest cocoa powder, creating our Mörk chocolate blends in small batches to ensure consistency and freshness.
