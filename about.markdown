excerpt: Mörk Chocolate is a small business. We have one foot in the world of fine
  chocolate and one in the world of specialty coffee, with over ten years of professional
  experience in both Australia and Europe. "Mörk" is Swedish for dark, and the name
  speaks both to our shared history and our devotion to dark, pure chocolate.

Mörk Chocolate are makers of specialty, ethically sourced hot chocolate in Melbourne.

Inspired by Melbourne’s coffee culture ― which is considered by many to be the best in the world ― we have made it our mission to bring specialty hot chocolate onto the scene.

In 2012, we created the first Mörk hot chocolate blend using the same approach taken by specialty coffee-makers; with respect for the traceability, quality and unique origin of ingredients all the way from bean to cup. That’s what makes Mörk different from the drinking chocolate you find in supermarkets today.

Since then, the Mörk team has bloomed ― and so has our range. You can find it online or taste it in person at the Mörk Chocolate Brewhouse ― our cafe and on-site cacao roasting facility in North Melbourne, where we serve our specialty hot chocolate blends to loyal locals and everyday chocolate enthusiasts alike.
