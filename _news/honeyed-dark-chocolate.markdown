In this collaboration we have teamed up with local beekeepers Melbourne City Rooftop Honey. When we first met founders Vanessa and Mat we instantly got talking about their urban beehives, unique flora in each suburb, and honeyed chocolate concoctions. It was a pairing waiting to happen and with the hives now starting to fill up with new season honey, our Melbourne Honeyed Dark Chocolate was born!


The first honey is from: Alphington - paired with 70% pure dark chocolate. The Alphington bees produce a floral and buttery honey, marrying beautifully with the Venezuelan cacao in Mörk Chocolate. We will be rotating other beehive locations for unique and limited batches, throughout Spring and Summer.
