We often get asked how to best prepare our hot chocolate. There are only two secrets to the ultimate Mörk hot chocolate. Take notes:


## 1. Make it really strong

The Mörk chocolate flavour will be intensified with each spoon you add so be generous with the scoops.


## 2. Emulsify

With the high proportion of pure chocolate in our blends, care must be taken in the steps of preparation, just like with coffee. Make sure to stir or whisk liquid in to Mörk powder in steps to emulsify it. This will give you a beautifully silky result and a rich Mörk hot chocolate.

Whether you just bought your Mörk hot chocolate to make at home or work in a busy cafe, here is a quick brew guide for you:

## In the Jug

This method will give you an intense chocolate with heavier mouth feel and a silky finish.

In a small jug add 200 ml of cold full cream milk. Add 3 heaped tablespoons (30g) of Mörk powder and stir with a spoon until powder is wet. Then steam the chocolate until 65 degrees or slightly hotter than your regular milk and serve.

The guys at Krimper Coffee in Guildford Lane show us how they make it here: [https://vimeo.com/67855327](https://vimeo.com/67855327)
## Mörk at Home

In a pot, add 3-4 really heaped tablespoons of Mörk powder and 100 ml of cold milk. Turn the stove on to medium heat and whisk vigorously while gently heating it to room temperature. When the chocolate is starting to get warm and is silky smooth, add another 100 ml of cold milk, keep whisking and heat gently until just hot and serve.
