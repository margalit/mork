Since launching our unique range of dark chocolate beverages in 2012, we had dreamed of opening a specialty store that would enable our chocolate-obsessed fans a way to experience our products, while also offering a space to showcase more experimental and theatrical creations.


Three years later, our dream became a reality when we opened our all- chocolate Brew House in North Melbourne. Fans flocked to experience a range of dark Scandinavian-style drinking cacao, decadent dessert-style creations, and house-made chocolate cakes, cookies, and specialty pastry items.


However, one creation stood out amongst the offering - a smokey, interactive, theatrical item called “**Campfire Hot Chocolate**”. 
    

An instant Insta hit, the beverage went viral as much for its presentation as for its story: intended as a way for our founder Josefin Zernell to recreate her Swedish childhood memories of drinking chocolate by the fire, Campfire uses maplewood smoke, torched house-made marshmallow, and charcoal salt to accompany their signature ‘Original Dark’ 70% cacao drinking chocolate in creating a truly sensory experience.


Our **Campfire Hot Chocolate** is available exclusively at the [**Mörk Chocolate Brewhouse**](http://morkchocolate.com.au/find-us/) - 150 Errol Street, North Melbourne.
The Brew House is open from 9am-5pm Tuesday to Sunday.![campfire hot chocolate web-84feea.jpg](/uploads/campfire%20hot%20chocolate%20web-84feea.jpg)
