We are thrilled to invite you all to our newly opened chocolate brew house, dedicated entirely to the art of liquid chocolate.

Together with interior designer Danielle Oerman, we have converted a 1950s bakery warehouse into an 18-seat sensory experience. Danielle has given the space beautiful light, amazing features in walnut, brass and stone. Watch this space for an interview with Danielle about how this project came together.

We have also collaborated with a bunch of amazing Melbourne makers – Tuckbox Design for our incredible stools, Mark Jacob for stunning tables, superstars Loose Leaf for greenery, we have Missing Ear, Tufts and Shelley Panton to thank for crockery and clever Specht Design for wooden features, some for which are featured on our custom steaming station made by Rick Bond - The Coffee Machinist.

Menu highlights include the Breakfast Chocolate with house-made oat milk, dark chocolate and cinnamon, as well as a refreshing single-origin Chocolate Soda. The Campfire Chocolate has already become a favourite; customers lift a reversed, stemless wineglass to release smoke, before pouring the dark hot chocolate over the smoke and finishing it with house smoked salt. It also comes with a flamed marshmallow on a stick, for added nostalgia.
