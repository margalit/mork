When little chef Pierre showed up on Instagram some weeks ago, we simply couldn’t resist his charm. Returned here with his Valentine, he melts our dark chocolate hearts once again.


You may know Nessa Guillet from her amazing illustrations of [LuxBite’s](http://luxbite.com.au) decadent desserts, drawn with the most incredible details of merengue, mousse and plump berries. We don’t know whether we would rather eat them or hang them up on our walls to keep forever after.

Nessa grew up in France but now lives and works in Boston. Her artwork is inspired by vintage French poster designs, Aboriginal art, Japanese prints and her love for pastries and pâtisseries from her childhood in France. We think that anyone who can create such beautiful things must be a sweet genius. Find more of Nessa’s work here:
