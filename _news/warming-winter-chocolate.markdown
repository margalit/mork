Winter has arrived, bringing with it cold nights that nearly remind us of Scandinavian winters. No better cure to frost bite than to cuddle up with a hot chocolate and a blanket. Anyone knows that. Try our recipe for a warming hot chocolate and see for yourself. Best of all, it is dairy free.


Makes 1 cup

**25g Mörk chocolate**

**200ml coconut milk**

**1/2 teaspoon of dried chilli flakes**

**pinch of salt**

Combine all ingredients in a pot and let it simmer over a medium heat while whisking. Take off the heat for 5 minutes to infuse infuse the chilli. Return to the heat to warm before straining the chocolate over a tea strainer into a cup and serve.
