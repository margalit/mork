We are happy to announce that we are opening a concept store in late February!

The building is a 1950’s bakery warehouse in North Melbourne, which we are converting into our new concept store with a chocolate workshop at the back, for patient handcrafting of pure chocolate.


Stay informed about opening date and more details to come, by joining our mailing list.
