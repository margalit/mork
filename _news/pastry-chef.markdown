**Mörk Chocolate**


Thanks to a couple of new projects on the horizon - including one incredibly exciting new venture - our team is growing again!


We seek a PASTRY CHEF to join us in working with some of the best product in Melbourne. You will help us continue to create high-level products for our own cafe, and aid in developing new products that showcase the incredibly high quality cacao that we source.


● access to some of the finest chocolate and cacao in the world

● begin to specialise in chocolate work

● opportunity for growth and advancement


Working in our North Melbourne production/test kitchen, you will be required to produce a range of pastry cabinet items, as well as components and garnishes for our beverage menu. You will have experience in producing volume cakes and pastries, as well as the ability to both follow recipes and to work independently.


You will be working daytime hours alongside our Head Pastry Chef and our Development Chef. The role will be about 30hrs per week to start with, with the right candidate moving to full-time as we launch our new venture early in the new year.
