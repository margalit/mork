 We craft Mörk specialty hot chocolate with all-natural, not-so-secret ingredients. cacao powder; lavish blocks of 100% unsweetened chocolate; organic unrefined coconut blossom sugar ― it's all part of what makes Mörk Chocolate special.

Our ingredients are sourced ethically from local farmers and producers around the world who share our values. To learn more about chocolate traceability, please read [here](/about/).

What goes into our chocolate:

### Cacao Liquor
 It sounds exotic, but cacao liquor is simply honest, unsweetened dark chocolate. Our cacao liquor is sourced from Sur del Lago in South-Western Venezuela. Sur del Lago ― which literally means ‘south of the (Maracaibo) lake’ ― is one of the oldest cacao growing regions in the world. Spanning approximately 5,000 hectares of land, it demonstrates exceptional growing conditions for the more delicate varieties of cacao, such as the rare and aromatic Trinitario variety used in Mörk’s blends.

The Sur del Lago cacao liquor is characterised by richly distinct notes of ripe red berries, sweet almonds and stone fruit.  

### Organic Cacao Powder
 The Peruvian single origin cacao powder we use provides mouthfeel, body and balance to our blends and exhibits a rich, deep and well-rounded flavour.

### Organic Unrefined Coconut Blossom Sugar 
Obtained via a direct, independent trade agreement with a sustainable farm in West Java, Indonesia, our unrefined coconut blossom sugar has been hand selected by the Mörk team for its unique qualities and alignment to our values. Unlike refined sugars, organic unrefined coconut blossom sugar has a low-GI (glycemic index) rating, which is released more gradually into the bloodstream when consumed - meaning it doesn't cause that blood sugar spike (and subsequent crash in energy) that commercial confectionary does. This makes it ideal for diabetics and those watching their sugar intake.

### Process
Each Mörk blend takes time to create. We sample and test cacao from all over the world to arrive at the best possible balance of flavour, texture and consistency. We also blind taste our blends under a range of preparation methods, to ensure you get a consistent result in your cup.

Mörk drinking chocolate is produced in small batches to ensure we maintain the quality, consistency and freshness of our product ― no matter where or when you enjoy them. Each 250g bag is packed by hand and packaged in our locally-made custom cylinders, before they’re delivered to retailers, cafés, restaurants and your door. Mörk takes a hands-on approach to every product we sell; in fact, if you’re in the local area you might find your next order personally delivered by one of our chocolate makers themselves.
