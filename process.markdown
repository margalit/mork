We craft our Mörk hot chocolate with all-natural, not-so-secret ingredients. Cocoa powder, heavy blocks of pure unsweetened chocolate — 100% cacao liquor — and unrefined coconut blossom sugar.

### Cacao Liquor
Our liquor is from the cacao growing region of Sur del Lago in south-western Venezuela. Sur del Lago, which literally means ‘south of the (Maracaibo) lake’, is one of the oldest cacao growing regions in the world. It covers approximately 5,000 hectares of land that is used for cultivating cacao, and has exceptional growing conditions for the more delicate varieties of cacao, such as the comparatively rare and highly aromatic Trinitario variety used for our liquor.

The Sur del Lago cacao liquor has distinct flavours of ripe red berries, sweet almonds and stone fruit, and represents most of the top notes in the final chocolate.

### Organic Cocoa Powder
Our single origin cocoa powder is sourced from Peru it provides mouthfeel and balance, by adding body to the blend, alongside rich slightly roasted and rounded flavours. It is so-called “Dutched cocoa”, which means natural potassium solution has been added in the refining process to highlight depth in flavour and lower the highly acidic notes present in some types of cacao.

Organic Unrefined Coconut Blossom Sugar
We source our unrefined coconut blossom sugar via direct trade with a sustainable farm in West Java, Indonesia. The unique qualities of this type of low-GI sugar imparts an extremely pleasant savoury taste that discreetly balances the other elements of our hot chocolate. It is also a diabetic friendly sweetener.

### The Process
When creating our blends we source and taste chocolate from many various cacao varieties and origins to find the right balance of flavour as well as good texture in the cup. We blind taste the final blends in hot water as well as with full cream milk before our last bit of tweaking until we’re happy with it.

We produce our small batches of Mörk hot chocolate by finely grating the pure cacao liquor or chocolate and fusing it with the cocoa powder and coconut blossom sugar. A great deal of care is taken with every step of the process to ensure it always tastes as good as we can make it.

Having prepared every 250g bag by hand and packaged them in our locally made custom cylinders, we then deliver Mörk chocolate to wholesalers, retailers, cafés, restaurants - and to your door.
