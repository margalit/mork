### Visit our North Melbourne cafe - the Mörk Chocolate Brewhouse
For a true cacao-bean-to-cup experience, our Mörk Chocolate Brewhouse is open to the public- each day except Monday (when we’re busy making chocolates!) from 9am to 5pm.

Located in North Melbourne in a converted 1950s-era bakery, our cafe offers visitors a unique sensory experience - dedicated entirely to specialty chocolate.
