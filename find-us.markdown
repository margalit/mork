  We are located just meters away from the #57 tram line, which travels directly to and from Melbourne CBD.

  It takes less than 10 minutes to travel to Mörk by car from the city. It's also short walk or bike ride from Queen Vic Market, if you need some relaxation in between the bustling energy of Melbourne's crowds.

  Can't make it to our Brew House? Get your chocolate fix at our [online store](http://store.morkchocolate.com.au).

  If you’re located in the UK, we’ve got a special [London site](http://morkchocolate.co.uk) just for you."

### Visit our North Melbourne cafe - the Mörk Chocolate Brew House.

For a true cacao-bean-to-cup experience, our Mörk Chocolate Brew House is open to the public each day except Monday (when we’re busy making chocolates!) from 9am to 5pm.


Located in North Melbourne in a converted 1950s-era bakery, our cafe offers visitors a unique sensory experience - dedicated entirely to specialty chocolate.
