We’ve got some really exciting news to share.

When we set up Mörk Chocolate back in 2012, our aim was to share carefully sourced, beautifully crafted dark drinking chocolate with our fellow Melburnians. As a small, family-run business, we’ve been really fortunate in gaining so much local support and interest in what we do. 


Which is why we’re utterly ecstatic to announce that our chocolate has found its way overseas - we’re going to be extending our range into the UK market (kicking off with an initial launch taking place at [London Coffee Festival](http://www.londoncoffeefestival.com) from April 7-10).

For everyone back home, you’ll still be able to come into our [North Melbourne Brewhouse](http://morkchocolate.com.au/find-us/) to taste and experience a real small batch chocolate factory in action - so if you haven't visited us yet, drop in and say hi!

We couldn't have done this without all our wonderful customers, suppliers and friends who have supported us along the way. Thank you to you all.
