We are looking for a positive, creative and skilled bunch of individuals to join our small but tight team at MÃ¶rk. In our concept store / chocolate brew house, due to open in late February, we specialise in serving dark chocolate beverages. We have a chocolate workshop at the back where our chocolate is crafted and recipes created.


Our chocolate brew house and concept store will be open on 5 days a week, both Saturday and Sunday. We are looking to fill 2 casual / part time positions. 

If you have a burning interest and quest for craft chocolate, beautiful things, amazing flavours, and a desire to share your knowledge with others for a stand-out customer service experience in a team of like minded people, we would love to hear from you.

You must have experience in retail sales and/or hospitality, and strong customer service skills. A creative/esthetical mind will sync well with ours, as well as an ability to maintain a smiling face and professional manner in high pace as well as slow pace environment. We believe that attention to detail cannot be taught, so if you have it in you by nature, you are halfway there. 

If this is you in a nutshell, we would love to hear from you.

Best,

Kiril & Josefin
