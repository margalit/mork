**Housemade Oat Milk Recipe**

Made at Mörk Chocolate Brew House for our Breakfast Chocolate

Makes 2.5 L

250 g oats

1.9 L room tempered water

1 muslin cloth or Ultra Bag

800 ml coconut milk of high quality

5 tsp. coconut blossom sugar

2 pinches of salt


Soak the oats in water for 4-6 hours. Using a hand blender or food processor, blend the mixture until nearly smooth. Carefully pass the mixture through the muslin cloth into a large container, squeezing out the liquid and discarding the oats fibers. Add the coconut milk, coconut sugar and salt to the liquid and blend again. Use as a base for a nourishing hot chocolate.
